# ðŸš€ OPPistons: Removed annoying Limits of Pistons
Tired of  Minecraft's piston limits? OPPistons changes how pistons work, making them much more fun!

## ðŸ’ª What This Mod Does:
Move Any Block: Almost every block in Minecraft can now be pushed or pulled by pistons! The only exceptions are blocks like Command Blocks, Structure Blocks, Jigsaw Blocks, and Barriers. Don't worry, Bedrock is fully movable!

Massive Piston Limit: Say goodbye to the 12-block push limit! It's now set to the maximum integer value (2,147,483,647). That's enough to push 20 chunks that are filled from the top to the bottom with blocks (if your PC can handle it)

All Blocks Are Sticky: No need for slime blocks! With OPPistons, every block behaves as if it's sticky, allowing you to pull entire structures without them breaking apart.

## ðŸ“º YouTube Video Coming Soon!
I'll be uploading a video showcasing OPPistons on my YouTube channel soon. Stay tuned to see it in action: https://youtube.com/@NoSkinBadName
