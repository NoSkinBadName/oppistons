# ðŸš€ OPPistons: Removed annoying Limits of Pistons
Tired of vanilla Minecraft's piston limitations? OPPistons redefines how pistons work, making your experience much more fun!

## ðŸ’ª What This Mod Does:
Move Any Block: Almost every block in Minecraft can now be pushed or pulled by pistons! The only exceptions are blocks like Command Blocks, Structure Blocks, Jigsaw Blocks, and Barriers. Don't worry, Bedrock is fully movable!

Massive Piston Limit: Say goodbye to the 12-block push limit! We've cranked it up to the maximum integer value (2,147,483,647). That's enough to push 20 chunks that are filled from the top to the bottom with blocks (if your PC can handle it)

All Blocks Are Sticky: No more fumbling with slime blocks! With OPPistons, every block behaves as if it's "sticky," allowing you to pull entire structures without them breaking apart.

## ðŸ“º YouTube Video Coming Soon!
I'll be uploading a detailed video showcasing OPPistons on my YouTube channel soon. Stay tuned to see it in action: https://youtube.com/@NoSkinBadName
